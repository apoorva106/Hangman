In the file hangman-final, I have used the N-grams approach to make a hangman solver with approximate accuracy of 57%.

I also tried an ML-based approach using LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) and Transformers. However, the permutation solution took too long to run on the extremely large dataset and did not give any satisfactory results.

The description of both strategies is available in the pdf
